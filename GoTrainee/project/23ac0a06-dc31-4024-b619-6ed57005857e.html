The person enters information about
the car going to be offered at the auction. After that the system shows the recommended starting price.</p></div><div><h2 style="font-weight:500;font-size:30px;margin:10px 0">Requirements</h2><h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3><ul><li>VIN - unique identifier used in car industry to identify vehicles. Must be 17 characters long.</li><li>MSRP - manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price. Price set up by manufacturer when it starts selling a car. E.g., Tesla
Model S Performance has a MSRP of $99,000.</li></ul><h3 id="services">Services</h3><ul><li>VehicleService<ul><li>The service is a simple CRUD service that is used to load new vehicles to the system as well as to update the
existing ones.</li><li>The vehicles should be written to a storage.</li></ul></li><li>InspectionService<ul><li>The service is used to inspect vehicles. Allows to load more information about vehicles or the information that was
not provided to <code>VehicleService</code>.</li><li>The service has 2 endpoints:<ul><li><code>GetBuildData</code></li><li><code>InspectVehicle</code></li></ul></li><li>When the user calls <code>VehicleService</code> to load vehicles, the system should call <code>GetBuildData</code> service to get more
information about the vehicle and write data into a storage. If the data has been provided by both user and system,
the user data has higher priority.</li><li>The <code>GetBuildData</code> endpoint should receive only <code>VIN</code> and provide such vehicle data like <code>color</code>, <code>engine</code>,
<code>transmission</code> etc.</li><li>The <code>InspectVehicle</code> endpoint is used to calculate the vehicle condition grade.<ul><li>Accepts <code>VIN</code>, <code>Odometer</code>, <code>Year</code></li><li>Returns grade, which is an integer value from 0 to 50. 0 means a very bad condition, and 50 means excellent grade.</li><li>Validation rules are:<ul><li>If the car is older than 15 years then the grade cannot be higher 35.</li><li>If the odometer is greater than 300,000 km then the grade cannot be higher 30.</li><li>Each year the car loses 1 point in grade. E.g., 3 years old ideal car will have grade = 47, 7 years old - 43.</li><li>The presence of strong scratches reduces the grade by 1.08 times.</li><li>The presence of small scratches reduces the grade by 1.04 times.</li><li>Failures in the electrics reduce the grade by 1.08 times.</li><li>Suspension malfunctions reduce the grade by 1.06 times.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>PricingService<ul><li>Contains <code>GetRecommendedPrice</code> endpoint, which is used to compute the optimized price for the vehicle.<ul><li>Accepts <code>VIN</code>, <code>grade</code>, <code>odometer</code>, <code>exterior color</code>, <code>interior color</code>.</li><li>Required parameters are <code>VIN</code>, <code>grade</code> and <code>odometer</code>.</li><li>Returns price. The implementation must use parameters from the request listed above. It means, that the price
should depend on them. Also, the service should use the other vehicle data to compute the price. Such data can be
provided by either <code>InspectionService</code> or <code>VehicleService</code>.</li><li>Price value must be positive non-zero value, not above the MSRP.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><h2 style="font-weight:500;font-size:30px;margin:10px 0">Advanced Requirements</h2><ul><li>Implement bulk endpoints to load multiple vehicle data.</li><li>Implement batching of the multiple vehicle data. E.g., the user wants to load 1,000 vehicles. The system should split
data into several batches according to batch settings and load several batches in parallel while the other batches are
waiting for processing. Let&#x27;s say the batch size is 200, so the system should create 5 batches with 200 vehicles in
each batch. The logic should allow to configure how much batches can be processed in parallel (1, 2, etc.). If the
settings are confitured to process 2 batches at once, so the system should first load 2 batches with 200 vehicles in
parallel, then the next 2 batches and after that the rest batch.</li><li>Implement caching of the pricing calls to spead up the process and reduce the impact on the system when the user sends
same requests.</li><li>Think about possible pricing calls for the same vehicles(what parameters may change), and implement the caching of
such calls, so that when the user requests the price, it will be already in the system and there will be no need to
compute it during the call. It will reduce the response time.</li></ul></div></div></body>
